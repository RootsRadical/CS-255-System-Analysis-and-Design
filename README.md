# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was a client looking to develop a web-based application for people looking to study and receive instruction to achieve their drivers license. 

What did you do particularly well?

I thought I interpreted the clients needs quite well. The needs of the client were pretty straight forward but it still required some forward thing to ensure that the application was functional and secure. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I'd like to continue improving upon my different diagrams that we created. I felt like it took me a little bit to hit my stride but I still have a long way to go. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It's important to consider the user's needs because it is their application you are developing. We want to make sure we are creating something the client will be happy with. You have to take in all of the information that you can to create the best application you can right out of the gate.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I'm particulary fond of interviews. I think face to face conversation are the best tool to understanding what your client needs from you and the application. It isn't always easy to have a conversation that translates between tech and non-technical parties.
